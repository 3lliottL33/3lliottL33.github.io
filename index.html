            <p> I am currently a student at Oregon State University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science, expected to graduate in June 2027.</p>
            <p> This portfolio showcases my growth as a developer and highlights the projects I am most proud of.
                I am currently specializing in AI and Machine Learning, and I will begin relevant course work in the upcoming academic year.
            </p>

            <p> In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching tech or nature documentaries, and exploring new technologies. 
                I am always looking for ways to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the tech industry.

            <h1> Projects </h1>
            <h2> Raspberry Pi Frequency Detector </h2>
            <p> This works by determining the frequency of an audio and then converting it to a note. Due to the limitations of the current led board, 
                we had to compromise and make one scale fit all different octaves. This was done by using the modulo operator to determine the note in the octave.
            </p>

            <h2> Zombies Rising (A 2D Python Video Game) </h2>
            <p> This is a 2D game I made using Python. I implemented object-oriented programming in order to create each individual object and to detect object collisions.
                This game works by utilizing CodeSkulptor, which is a browser based Python interpreter.
            </p>

            <h2> Personal Website </h2>
            <p> This is the website you are currently on! I made this website using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.
                I had relevant course work in web development and I wanted to apply what I learned to make a personal website that would showcase my skills and projects.
