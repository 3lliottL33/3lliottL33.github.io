      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/me_updated.jpg" style="width:60%">
      <p><font size="+1">I am currently an undergraduate student enrolled at Oregon State University, 
        pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My curiosity and passion for technology drive me to
        continously explore new concepts and study them analytically. As someone who loves to learn, this reflects into my hobbies.
        I am recently learning how to improve at chess, learning how to draw, and relearning Korean. Each of these activities challenge me 
        to think in different ways, whether it is strategic thinking and analyzing, creativity, or being proficient in multiple methods
        of communication. I believe that engaging in diverse methods of thinking harbors new solutions and innovation.<font></p>
         <br>
      <p><font size="+1">I enjoy playing video games and socializing with people as well as
        programming.<font></p>
